            * Added title to the main window: Electoral Calculator
            
            * Show the main window maximized by default
            
            * Created a new file (calculations.py) for the functions used to calculate the results

            * Added some doctests for the D'Hondt, Sainte-Laguë, and modified Sainte-Laguë methods

            * Created a enum like class to identify the different calculation methods and adapt the code to use them

            * When two quots are equal the calculus is not correct:
                * a: 1000 and b:500 -> a: 2 and b: 0 CORRECT (2 seats)
                  but a: 500 and b: 1000 -> a:1 and b:1 INCORRECT (2 seats) (my app and http://www.calculoescanos.com/ but http://icon.cat/util/elections gets the correct answer).

        * New features:

            * Cuando en la relacion de cocientes coincidan dos correspondientes a distintas candidaturas, el escaño se atribuira a la que mayor numero total de votos hubiese obtenido.
