      Avoid the possibility of adding a candidature with a empty name to the candidature list
      
        * The problem is here:
            try:
               self.votes[self.txtParty.get_text()] = int(self.txtVotes.get_text())
            except:
                if self.txtParty.get_text() == "":
                    self.show_info_message(self, "The name of the party can't be empty")
                    self.txtParty.grab_focus()
                    return 1             
                else:
                    self.show_info_message(self, "The number of votes must be an integer value")
                    self.txtVotes.set_text("")
                    self.txtVotes.grab_focus()
                    return 1
          
          The dictionary accepts empty key values, so doesn't throw an exception.

        * Solution: Move the code that checks if the name of the party is empty out of the exception handler.

      The calculus to get the votes needed to obtain the last seat are not correct (D'Hondt method):

        * a 1000    b 500   -> a: 2 ; b: 0 (2 seats)
           votes to last seat: a: 0 ; b: 1 CORRECT (my app and http://icon.cat/util/elections)
                           but a: 0 ; b: 0 INCORRECT (http://www.calculoescanos.com)
                           
        * a 1000    b 501   -> a: 1 ; b: 1 (2 seats)
           votes to last seat: a: 3 ; b: 0 INCORRECT (my app and http://icon.cat/util/elections)
                  it should be a: 2 ; b: 0 CORRECT (http://www.calculoescanos.com)
           after the first fix a: 2 ; b: 0 CORRECT 2012-05-22

        * a 1000    b 500   -> a: 1 ; b: 0 (1 seat)
           votes to last seat: a: 0 ; b: 500 INCORRECT ??? Is it enough to draw?
                it should be   a: 0 ; b: 501 I think that the correct answer is 501, as it's the votes needed to be sure that this party wins the next seat.
           after the 2nd fix   a: 0 ; b: 501 CORRECT 2012-05-22
           
        * a 1000    b 500   c 333 -> a: 2 ; b: 0; c: 0 (2 seats)
            votes to last seat: a: 0 ; b: 1; c: 167 INCORRECT
                it should be    a: 0 ; b: 1; c: 168
            after the 3rd fix   a: 0 ; b: 1; c: 168 CORRECT 2012-05-22

        * a 1000    b 500   c 333 -> a: 2 ; b: 1; c: 0 (3 seats)
            votes to last seat: a: 500 ; b: 0; c: 168 CORRECT ???
            c: 167 -> 333 + 167 -> 500 Draw with b. But I think 168 is correct as it's the votes needed to be sure that this party wins the next seat.

        * ...
        
        * What about the other methods?

      It's D'Hondt not d'Hondt. Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:D%27Hondt_method#Capitalization.3F

      2012-05-18 Error that happens when using the imperiali method
    
        * Error message:

            Traceback (most recent call last):
              File "ElectoralCalculator.py", line 248, in on_btnCalculate_clicked
                (results, nextSeat) = calculateHighestAverage(self.votes, numSeats, self.method, threshold, votePercentages)

            TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'float' and 'list'

        * The problem is here:
            In the function getDivisor:
            69    elif method == "Imperiali":
            70        return range(numSeats + 2)
            
            A range (a list) is returned instead of a number.

        * Solution: Use "return numSeats + 2" instead of "return range(numSeats + 2)"
