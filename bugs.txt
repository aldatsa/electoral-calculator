Bugs:

    * When two or more parties have the same amount of votes the calculus is not correct:
        * a: 1000 and b: 1000 -> a: 1 and b: 0 INCORRECT (2 seats) (my app, http://icon.cat/util/elections and http://www.calculoescanos.com/)
          See Improvements.
          
    * The calculus to get the votes needed to obtain the last seat are not correct:
        * a 1000    b 500   -> a: 2 ; b: 0 (2 seats)
           votes to last seat: a: 0 ; b: 1 CORRECT (my app and http://icon.cat/util/elections)
                           but a: 0 ; b: 0 INCORRECT (http://www.calculoescanos.com)
                           
        * a 1000    b 501   -> a: 1 ; b: 1 (2 seats)
           votes to last seat: a: 3 ; b: 0 INCORRECT (my app and http://icon.cat/util/elections)
                  it should be a: 2 ; b: 0 CORRECT (http://www.calculoescanos.com)
    
Corrected bugs:

    * Corrected in 0.5.3:
    
        * Correct the year shown in the About window.

        * Substitute the example URL with the URL of the project's Launchpad page in the About window.

    * Corrected in 0.5.2:
    
        * Show the results in the TreeView. Since the functions were changed the UI doesn't work.
        
        * When two quots are equal the calculus is not correct:
            * a: 1000 and b:500 -> a: 2 and b: 0 CORRECT (2 seats)
              but a: 500 and b: 1000 -> a:1 and b:1 INCORRECT (2 seats) (my app and http://www.calculoescanos.com/ but http://icon.cat/util/elections gets the correct answer).

    * Corrected in 0.5.1:
    
        * If the number of votes is small and the number of seats it's quite big:
        asier@asier-laptop ~/Dokumentuak/Proiektuak/D'hontCalculator/0.3 $ python pydhondt.py 
            {'a': 12}
            defaultdict(<type 'list'>, {'a': [12, 6, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]})
            Seat #1 goes to: a with 12 votes
            Seat #2 goes to: a with 6 votes
            Seat #3 goes to: a with 4 votes
            Seat #4 goes to: a with 3 votes
            Seat #5 goes to: a with 2 votes
            Seat #6 goes to: a with 2 votes
            Seat #7 goes to: a with 1 votes
            Seat #8 goes to: a with 1 votes
            Seat #9 goes to: a with 1 votes
            Seat #10 goes to: a with 1 votes
            Seat #11 goes to: a with 1 votes
            Seat #12 goes to: a with 1 votes
            Seat #13 goes to:  with 0 votes

            IndexError: pop from empty list

Improvements (Wish list):
    * Add options window:
        * D'hondt method:
            * Threshold calculus: votes[party]/totalVotes or votes[party]/validVotes
            * Votes percent: votes[party]/totalVotes or votes[party]/validVotes
            
    * Add more calculation methods (check wikipedia):
        * Highest averages methods: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highest_averages_method
            * IMPLEMENTED 0.5.0 - Sainte-Laguë method: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Lagu%C3%AB_method and Modified Sainte-Laguë
        * Largest remainder methods:
            * Hare quota IMPLEMENTED 0.5.3
            * Droop quota IMPLEMENTED 0.5.3
            * Imperiali quota    
            
    * What to do when the quots or the number of votes of two parties are equal?
        * In Spain: 
            * IMPLEMENTED 0.5.2 - Cuando en la relacion de cocientes coincidan dos correspondientes a distintas candidaturas, el escaño se atribuira a la que mayor numero total de votos hubiese obtenido. 
            * Si hubiera dos candidaturas con igual numero total de votos, el primer empate se resolvera por sorteo y los sucesivos de forma alternativa.
    
    * The possibility to do comparations of the results using different methods
    
    * The possibility to save the data
    
    * Add info about each calculation method (from wikidedia)
    
Implemented improvements:
    * 0.5.3
        * Added two largest remainder methods: Hare quota and droop quota.
    * 0.5.2
        * Cuando en la relacion de cocientes coincidan dos correspondientes a distintas candidaturas, el escaño se atribuira a la que mayor numero total de votos hubiese obtenido. 
    * 0.5.0
        * Added three highest averages methods: Sainte-Lague, Modified Sainte-Laguë and Imperiali.
